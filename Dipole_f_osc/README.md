The files presented here contains 8 columns
the first one is the cut-off radius for the used form of potential

Seccon one is related to the form of potential used and is not of interest for the users

Third and fourth are upper level main and orbital quantum numbers
fith and sixt onea are same for lower level

Ther folowing are dipole matrix element and the oscillator strength
